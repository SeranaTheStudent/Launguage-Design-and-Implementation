This project is a basic interpreter for a custom expression language, written entirely in Python.

This is a simple interpreter for a custom language written in Python.

Language Features:
- Integer and float arithmetic: +, -, *, /
- Boolean logic: and, or, not
- Comparisons: ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=
- Print statements (optional)
- Concatenate strings

Example Syntax:
---------------
print(5 + 3 * 2);
print(true and false);
print(!(5 == 4));

You can enter these style of expressions line by line in a txt file in this format: print(syntax here);
The txt file can be in any location, as long as the file path is correct.

For further instructions to run the interpreter, see BUILD.txt.
